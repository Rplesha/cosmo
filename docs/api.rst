API

.. We don't need to go too much into detail on the monitor pi and we can refer to the framework's documentation for more
    detailed descriptions.
    We should primarily cover:
    1. How to run the monitors (both sequentially or all at once)
    2. A brief description of how the data models work and interact with the monitor.
    Additionally, we should describe how to access monitoring data for use outside of the scope of monitoring.
    3. API for filesystem.py
    4. API for monitor_helpers.py
    5. API for the sms subpackage
    6. API for retrieval
