COS Monitors
============
The monitors in COSMO are designed to provide information on the health of the COS instrument, changes in behavior of
the detectors or mechanical components, and target acquisition statuses and trends.
These monitors allow the COS Branch at STScI to detect and resolve issues with the COS instrument or acquisitions
quickly as well as track the evolution of the instrument over time in order to provide the best science products and
scientific capabilities to the astronomical community.

Currently, COSMO supports monitoring in three areas of COS operations:

- Target Acquisitions
- Optics Select Mechanism (OSM) trends/evolution
- Dark rate trends/evolution

These monitors build off of a previous COS Branch monitoring program, an overview of which is given in
`Technical Instrument Report COS 2014-04 <https://innerspace.stsci.edu/download/attachments/166755094/TIR2014_04.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1557948271236&api=v2>`_.
